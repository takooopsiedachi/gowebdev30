## Day 2: Learn Go Basics - Part 1

Today, you'll focus on learning the basics of Go, including syntax, data types, and variables.

### Study Go syntax

Understand the basic structure of a Go program, including package declarations, imports, and the main function. A simple Go program looks like this:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```

- `package main`: Every Go program starts with a package declaration. The `main` package is the entry point of the program.
- `import "fmt"`: This line imports the `fmt` package, which provides functions for formatted I/O.
- `func main()`: The `main` function is the starting point of the program execution.

### Learn about data types

Study Go's basic data types, including integers, floats, booleans, and strings.

- Integers: `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`
- Floats: `float32`, `float64`
- Booleans: `bool`
- Strings: `string`

### Understand variables

Learn how to declare and initialize variables in Go, as well as how to use short variable declarations.

1. Declare a variable with a specific type:

```go
var x int
```

2. Declare a variable with an initial value:

```go
var y int = 42
```

3. Declare a variable without specifying the type (Go will infer the type based on the initial value):

```go
var z = "Hello"
```

4. Short variable declaration (available only within a function):

```go
a := 42
b := "World"
```

Now that you have a basic understanding of Go syntax, data types, and variables, continue to practice and explore these concepts.

## Day 3: Learn Go Basics - Part 2

Today, you'll continue learning Go basics by focusing on constants, loops, and conditionals.

### Learn about constants

Understand the use of constants in Go and how to declare them. Constants are values that cannot be changed once they are initialized.

1. Declare a constant:

```go
const pi = 3.14159
```

2. Declare multiple constants at once:

```go
const (
    red   = "red"
    blue  = "blue"
    green = "green"
)
```

### Study loops

Learn about for loops and range in Go, and understand how to use them for iteration.

1. Basic for loop:

```go
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
}
```

2. For loop with a condition (similar to a while loop):

```go
n := 1
for n < 100 {
    n *= 2
}
```

3. Iterate over a slice or array using range:

```go
numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
for index, value := range numbers {
    fmt.Printf("Index: %d, Value: %d\n", index, value)
}
```

### Understand conditionals

Learn how to use if, else, and switch statements in Go.

1. If statement:

```go
if x > 0 {
    fmt.Println("x is positive")
}
```

2. If-else statement:

```go
if y < 0 {
    fmt.Println("y is negative")
} else {
    fmt.Println("y is non-negative")
}
```

3. If-else if-else statement:

```go
if z < 0 {
    fmt.Println("z is negative")
} else if z > 0 {
    fmt.Println("z is positive")
} else {
    fmt.Println("z is zero")
}
```

4. Switch statement:

```go
switch color {
case "red":
    fmt.Println("The color is red")
case "blue":
    fmt.Println("The color is blue")
case "green":
    fmt.Println("The color is green")
default:
    fmt.Println("Unknown color")
}
```

Now that you have learned about constants, loops, and conditionals in Go, continue to practice and explore these concepts.

## Day 4: Learn Go Basics - Part 3

Today, you'll continue learning Go basics by focusing on functions, error handling, and slices.

### Study functions

Learn how to define and call functions in Go, including how to work with multiple return values and named return values.

1. Define a function:

```go
func greet(name string) {
    fmt.Printf("Hello, %s!\n", name)
}
```

2. Call a function:

```go
greet("Alice")
```

3. Function with return value:

```go
func square(x int) int {
    return x * x
}
```

4. Function with multiple return values:

```go
func divmod(a, b int) (int, int) {
    return a / b, a % b
}
```

5. Function with named return values:

```go
func split(sum int) (x, y int) {
    x = sum / 2
    y = sum - x
    return
}
```

### Learn about error handling

Understand Go's approach to error handling, and learn how to use the error type and the defer statement.

1. Functions that return errors:

```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
)

func divide(a, b int) (int, error) {
	if b == 0 {
		return 0, errors.New("division by zero")
	}
	return a / b, nil
}

func main() {
	result, err := divide(10, 0)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error:", err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Result:", result)
	}
}

```

2. Check for errors:

```go
data, err := readFile("file.txt")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error:", err)
    return
}
fmt.Println("Data:", data)
```

3. Defer statement:

```go
func processFile(filename string) {
    file, err := os.Open(filename)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        return
    }
    defer file.Close()

    // ... process the file ...
}
```

### Explore slices

Learn about slices in Go, including how to create, access, and modify them.

1. Create a slice:

```go
numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

2. Access elements in a slice:

```go
fmt.Println(numbers[0]) // 1
```

3. Modify elements in a slice:

```go
numbers[1] = 42
```

4. Slice length and capacity:

```go
fmt.Println(len(numbers)) // 5
fmt.Println(cap(numbers)) // 5
```

5. Create a slice with `make`:

```go
newSlice := make([]int, 3, 5) // length: 3, capacity: 5
```

6. Append elements to a slice:

```go
numbers = append(numbers, 6, 7, 8)
```

Now that you have learned about functions, error handling, and slices in Go, continue to practice and explore these concepts.

## Day 5: Study Go packages and imports

### Go module

üêπ Complete the tutorial at https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/

### Learn about packages

Understand the concept of packages in Go, and learn how to create and use custom packages.

1. Create a new directory for your package:

```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/myproject/mypackage
```

2. Create a new Go file inside the package directory:

```bash
touch $GOPATH/src/myproject/mypackage/mypackage.go
```

3. Define your package and its exported functions:

```go
package mypackage

func MyFunction() {
    // ... implementation ...
}
```

### Study imports

Learn how to import packages into your Go programs, and understand the difference between local and remote imports.

1. Import a package from the standard library:

```go
import "fmt"
```

2. Import a local package:

```go
import "myproject/mypackage"
```

3. Import a remote package:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func main() {
    router := gin.Default()
    router.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
        c.JSON(200, gin.H{
            "message": "Hello, world!",
        })
    })
    router.Run()
}

```

## Day 6: Learn about Go's Standard Library

Today, you'll explore common packages in Go's standard library and practice using them in small programs.

### Explore common packages

Study the functionality provided by common packages in Go's standard library, such as `fmt`, `io`, `bufio`, `os`, `strings`, `strconv`, and `time`.

- `fmt`: Provides formatted I/O functions, similar to C's `printf` and `scanf`.
- `io`: Contains basic interfaces for I/O operations, such as `Reader` and `Writer`.
- `bufio`: Implements buffered I/O for an efficient reading and writing experience.
- `os`: Provides functions for working with the operating system, such as file operations and environment variables.
- `strings`: Contains functions for manipulating strings, such as searching, replacing, and splitting.
- `strconv`: Provides functions for converting strings to and from other data types, such as integers and floats.
- `time`: Contains functionality for working with time and dates, such as parsing, formatting, and calculating durations.

### Practice using standard library packages

Write small Go programs to practice using the standard library packages you learned about.

1. Read a file using `os` and `bufio`:

```go
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    file, err := os.Open("input.txt")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
        return
    }
    defer file.Close()

    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
    for scanner.Scan() {
        fmt.Println(scanner.Text())
    }

    if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error reading file:", err)
    }
}
```

2. Manipulate strings using `strings` and `strconv`:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "strconv"
    "strings"
)

func main() {
    s := "Hello, Gopher!"

    fmt.Println(strings.ToUpper(s))
    fmt.Println(strings.ReplaceAll(s, "Gopher", "World"))

    n := 42
    sn := strconv.Itoa(n)
    fmt.Println("The number is: " + sn)
}
```

3. Work with time using `time`:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    now := time.Now()
    fmt.Println("Current time:", now)

    future := now.Add(72 * time.Hour)
    fmt.Println("72 hours later:", future)

    layout := "2006-01-02 15:04:05"
    parsedTime, err := time.Parse(layout, "2023-01-01 00:00:00")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error parsing time:", err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Println("Parsed time:", parsedTime)
}
```

Continue to explore and practice using Go's standard library packages to become more familiar with their functionality and use cases.
